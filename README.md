# Campus-Scale IoT Gateway Components
This repository contains the necessary instructions and components to set up a gateway within the Campus-Scale IoT infrastruture

## Initialize Gateway

To connect with ThingsBoard, the gateways utilize an open-source software stack called ThingsBoard gateway, the source code for which can be found in [thingsboard-gateway](./thingsboard-gateway)

Follow the instructions [here](https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/getting-started/) to configure the gateway and the instructions [here](https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/install/source-installation/) to install the gateway from source.

**NOTE:** Skip "Step 2" of the source install instructions. There is no need to clone from the official repository as the source code already lives in [thingsboard-gateway](./thingsboard-gateway)
