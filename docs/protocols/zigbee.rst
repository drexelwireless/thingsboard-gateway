ZigBee Gateway Setup
====================

NOTE: Many of these instructions are lifted from the
`official Zigbee2MQTT setup instructions <https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/getting-started/>`_ and
consolidated here.

Hardware Setup
--------------

This guide assumes the user has a `Texas Instruments LAUNCHXL-CC26X2R1 <https://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-CC26X2R1>`_,
which will act as the coordinator for the gateway's ZigBee network. You will need to flash the adapter with ZigBee
coordinator firmware. This should be done from your laptop/desktop/ a system separate from your gateway.

#. Download `coordinator firmware <https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/raw/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_3.x.0/bin/CC2652R_coordinator_20220219.zip>`_ for the TI Launchpad

   * Firmware path and filename should not contain any spaces (otherwise flashing may fail with "Error! Unable to open file ...").

#. Download and install `UNIFLASH <http://www.ti.com/tool/download/UNIFLASH>`_

#. Connect your LAUNCHXL-CC26X2R1 to your laptop/desktop/system via USB

#. Open UNIFLASH. UNIFLASH should automatically detect your device, it should appear under "Detected Devices" as "CC26X2R1 Launchpad". Press "Start"

#. Go to *Settings & Utilities* -> *Manual Erase* and press *Erase Entire Flash*

#. Go to *Settings & Utilities* -> *Program Load* and select *All Unprotected Sectors*, click *Perform Blank Check*

#. Go to *Program* -> *Flash Image(s)*, press *Browse* to select the firmware.

#. Click *Load image* to upload the firmware

**Note:** If at any point UniFlash tells you to update the firmware, do so. If you have already erased the flash, do it again. If you encounter an error after updating the firmware, unplug and re-plug the board, then erase again.

Software Setup
--------------

#. Remove the TI Launchpad from your desktop/laptop and connect it to your gateway via USB

#. Follow the instructions as-described in the `Linux Zigbee2MQTT Setup Instructions <https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/installation/01_linux.html>`_.

   * Be sure to follow the *(Optional) Running as a daemon with systemctl* instructions as well so that Zigbee2MQTT starts up when the gateway does.
   * Do not do the optional step involving generating a network key
   * To easily check if `/dev/ACM0` exists, `cd ~/thingsboard-gateway/setup_files` and `./walk.sh`. This script will print out all device paths of connected devices.
   * If `/dev/ACM0` does not exist after plugging in, reboot the gateway with the board still plugged in.
   * If there are other ZigBee networks nearby, you will need to configure your network to operate on a different channel. This is most easily done by checking the ZigBee configuration file `<zigbee installation directory>/data/configuration.yaml` of the other ZigBee networks if possible. The alternative is trial and error. Start with channel 15 and work your way up (start with 15 to try to avoid 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi overlaps). Append the following to your `/opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/configuration.yaml` to change the channel:
      ::
         
         advanced:
            channel: 15

#. Once the above is complete, the next step is to :ref:`add the IP address for the gateway to Flask<add-gateway-ip-address>`

NOTE: Currently, you will have to add the IP address to Flask everytime the device is turned off and on, as it does not store it in memory.
